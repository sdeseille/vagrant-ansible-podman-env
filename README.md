# Preparing Podman environment with Vagrant and ansible_local provisioner

Almost a year ago, I wrote this article [Preparing Docker environment with Vagrant and ansible_local provisioner](https://dev.to/sdeseille/preparing-docker-environment-with-vagrant-and-ansiblelocal-provisioner-18b8)

Recently, I discovered [Podman](https://github.com/containers/podman), so I decided to git it a try and that's what my article is about. You will see lots of similarities with my previous article. It is volontary. I practice lazyness. :p
